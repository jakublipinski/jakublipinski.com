Pause was an mobile application developed by [Polidea](/en/polidea) in 2012. The app worked by tracking the amount of time your phone is in Airplane Mode: open the app and set the amount of time you want to be offline and the activity you plan on doing. Finally, activate the Airplane Mode in your phoneâ€™s Settings to complete the process. Read a book, cook a meal, talk with your friends - disconnect from the digital to reconnect to the real.

Pause was discontinued in 2015.
