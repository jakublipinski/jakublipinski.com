There has never been a more intense time for me than when I was running a company (or two for a while). Each day brought new challenges: a valuable employee received an offer from a competitor, a client complained about the quality of our services, the structure of the company no longer suited the current challenges. A real rollercoaster. Every day I worked hard trying to come up with new solutions. Having no business experience, it often turned out that I was reinventing the wheel, not knowing that certain problems were solved in a certain way. I also missed looking from the side at what I was doing, catching some distance, enjoying what I had achieved and strategically facing what was ahead of me. I remember conversations with people who also ran a business and were more experienced, how much they opened a new perspective on the current struggles.

Today, after selling two companies, I offer business mentoring services to others. If you are a business owner, founder, entrepreneur, executive or manager in a tech- or science-based company my personalized mentoring services can help you navigate these challenges and achieve your full potential.

My mentoring services are designed to help you in various areas, including:

- unifying your **company's vision, strategy, and action plan** among the stakeholders; 


- formalizing arrangements in the form of **a shareholders agreement**; understanding vesting;


- developing your **leadership skills as a CEO** or board member; building **company structure, culture, values, and purpose**; designing **processes and OKRs**; 


- managing **hiring, onboarding, and letting people go**; building a fair and rewarding **compensation** package and **ESOP**; 


- building and running **a technical team**; 


- raising funds from **pitch deck to exit** strategy; 


- building an **acquisition-ready company**, preparing for **the due-diligence** process, and managing internal and external communication related to acquisition; 


- achieving **work-life balance and impact**.

I provide one-on-one or group mentoring sessions tailored to your specific needs and goals. We can arrange a meeting in person or over a conference call. Additionally, we can arrange a longer-form workshop, go for a hike together, or we can meet at [Farmia](https://farmia.org). I draw on my experience and knowledge to offer practical advice and guidance that can help you achieve your goals.
