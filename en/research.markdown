[Enhanced performance of gene expression predictive models with protein-mediated spatial chromatin interactions](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535849v1) [![Archived PDF](/assets/images/pdf.svg){: style="width:1em; display: inline; margin: 0 0 0rem;" }](/assets/pdf/2023.04.06.535849v1.full.pdf)

<small>There have been multiple attempts to predict the expression of the genes based on the
sequence, epigenetics, and various other factors. To improve those predictions, we have
decided to investigate adding protein-specific 3D interactions that play a major role in the
compensation of the chromatin structure in the cell nucleus. To achieve this, we have used
the architecture of one of the state-of-the-art algorithms, ExPecto (J. Zhou et al., 2018), and
investigated the changes in the model metrics upon adding the spatially relevant data. We
have used ChIA-PET interactions that are mediated by cohesin (24 cell lines), CTCF (4 cell
lines), and RNAPOL2 (4 cell lines). As the output of the study, we have developed the
Spatial Gene Expression (SpEx) algorithm that shows statistically significant improvements
in most cell lines.</small>

[FIREcaller: Detecting Frequently Interacting Regions from Hi-C Data](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020305511)
[![Archived PDF](/assets/images/pdf.svg){: style="width:1em; display: inline; margin: 0 0 0rem;" }](/assets/pdf/1-s2.0-S2001037020305511-main.pdf)

<small>Abstract: Hi-C experiments have been widely adopted to study chromatin spatial organization, which plays an essential role in genome function. We have recently identified frequently interacting regions (FIREs) and found that they are closely associated with cell-type-specific gene regulation. However, computational tools for detecting FIREs from Hi-C data are still lacking. In this work, we present FIREcaller, a stand-alone, user-friendly R package for detecting FIREs from Hi-C data. FIREcaller takes raw Hi-C contact matrices as input, performs within-sample and cross-sample normalization, and outputs continuous FIRE scores, dichotomous FIREs, and super-FIREs. Applying FIREcaller to Hi-C data from various human tissues, we demonstrate that FIREs and super-FIREs identified, in a tissue-specific manner, are closely related to gene regulation, are enriched for enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions, tend to overlap with regions exhibiting epigenomic signatures of cis-regulatory roles, and aid the interpretation or GWAS variants.</small>
